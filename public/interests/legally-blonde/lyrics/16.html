                    The ballad is interesting to me since it went through so many changes! As compared to the rest of the songs/scenes during the Pre-Broadway shows, this was the one they were figuring out the most. The other songs stayed mostly similar (a few lines were changed) but this definetly had the most drastic change. Even considering the path that Positive went down, I think the ballad still stands. It always had the same vibe (and similar lyrics) throughout its history. I thought it was interesting that they changed it up so much and then went back to most of the original lyrics!

                    I like the final version the most, particularly because it has Emmett reuse Elle's melody used earlier in What You Want. It's a great parallel to her adopting his own at the end of Chip on My Shoulder, it shows how they've grown to understand and appreciate one another on a deeper level. The fact it wasn't there originally is crazy to think about. Especially since I think it really highlights the development in their relationship.

                    With that considered, though, I do like the final Pre-Broadway version and all of the times that Emmett echoed the "Back to the sun, back to shore" and his reply to "Some girls fight hard / Some face the tiral" lines. I think it sounds really pretty.

                    Before they had Elle tell Emmett what happened with Callahan/why she's leaving, there was a scene they eventually had to cut where Emmett actually shows up at The Hair Affair in another attempt to stop her. He leaves before the next song happens. With the few shows it happened in, I get why, and I'm glad they cut it. Even though I adore Elle and Emmett, Vivienne being the one to begin Elle's peptalk speaks volumes and is why the Legally Blonde (Remix) is my favourite song from the musical. The development for Vivienne, and subsequently her relationship with Elle, really pays off in the final version than it did in the Pre-Broadway shows where Emmett was there.

                    I do have my own thoughts about how the whole thing was orchestrated, but maybe that's for another page...

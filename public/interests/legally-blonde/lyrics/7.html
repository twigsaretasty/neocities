                        * = modern productions generally say "playlist" instead here, since no one uses CDs anymore lol
                        <br><br>
                        I think this song is one of my least favourites, but I still like it a lot! It's quirky but it highlights Paulette's quirkiness. I love how random it is because Paulette is pretty random. I also love the random "sailor named Brendan" line (and the dancing line) simply because of the payoff in Legally Blonde (Remix). It's just too good.

                        It is quite interesting that this was barely changed! I was expecting it to have a few iterations but as I was transcribing the first Pre-Broadway show, I realized that it was already pretty much the same as what's on the Original Broadway Cast recording. Only a few words were changed, but other than that, it's the same! I did know that it was changed for the West End production, and typically all modern productions use that version. There are a few that don't, but I'm not sure why...

                        I really like this song and Michael Rupert's vocals make it worth sooo much more. It really sets up Callahan's character in a way that shows you that he doesn't actually care about anything other than getting what he wants. His lines in Whipped Into Shape ("I'm her only chance to win") again highlight this, which makes what happens with Elle make a lot of sense. He tells her to follow her instincts.
                        <br><br>
                        The ending is what really sells it for me, the last few lines just sound so nice. One detail I've noticed is that when the students are laughing at Elle for getting kicked out of class, Emmett doesn't participate in that. He does, however, join in singing the "blood in the water" part with the rest of them at the end.

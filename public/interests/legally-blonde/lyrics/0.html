                    <p class="menu-text">At first, I just did this for the Legally Blonde ballad, but I decided to just go for it and look at each of the songs</p>
                    <p class="menu-text">most info can be found on each page's second box on the lefthand side, but as a rundown:</p>
                    <ul class="text menu-list">
                        <li>text with no highlights is either part of the first iteration, or wasn't changed from one version to another</li>
                        <li>text with <span class="new">this hightlight</span> is a brand new lyric</li>
                        <li>text with <span class="reused">this hightlight</span> is a lyric that had been cut, but was brought back</li>
                        <li>text with <span class="moved">this hightlight</span> is a lyric that had been in a different part of the song, but was moved around</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p class="menu-text">some disclaimers because i'm extra</p>
                    <ul class="text menu-list">
                        <li>not every show was recorded, so the dates/counts may be slightly inaccurate</li>
                        <li>it's also possible that "changes" i take note of weren't real changes, but times where the actors happened to mess up a lyric or two during the show</li>
                        <li>ignore any spelling mistakes. lol</li>

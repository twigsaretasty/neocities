                    This is my second favourite song in the musical! I love the 
                    vibe of it and it's probably the one I've listened to the 
                    most. I love the development it provides for Elle and Emmett's 
                    relationship in the way that Chip on My Shoulder did. Instead of Emmett helping Elle, though, it's about Elle helping Emmett. It just highlights how much they can learn from one another since they're pretty different in terms of what they're best at. I love it when relationships are built off the foundation of learning from one another and growing together. It's super special!

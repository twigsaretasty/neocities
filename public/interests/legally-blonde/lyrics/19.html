                        This was a song that was reworked into Ireland. I was initially just going to use this first version on that page, but since Elle doesn't sing in Ireland, I figured I would give it it's own. As far as I'm aware, it's the only song that was cut completely from the show that was released elsewhere. It was released with the demo track, and was performed live with early versions of Blood in the Water, Legally Blonde, and Beacon of Positivity (reworked into Positive).

                        I get why they cut it, but I like the vibe of this song. It gets stuck in my head a lot. I love the "your boy will act much cuter once he's neutered!" "hello!" lines lol. Since it didn't change (from what I could tell) between the demo and live performance, there's only one here... I do wonder about what the choreography for this looked like haha.

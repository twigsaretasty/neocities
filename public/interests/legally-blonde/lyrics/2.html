                    <p class="text">
                        I did this right after Positive (which had 13 variations) so I am very grateful this only had 2 versions!
                        <br><br>
                        I love this song so much (like I say for every one of them) but this just has a special energy to it that I just appreciate. The way Elle starts to sing and then Warner cuts her off is not only funny but perfectly sets up his character lol. I giggle every time I hear it because it's just so good. Not only that, but Elle's actions on stage (giving Warner her left hand instead of her right, wiggling her ring finger multiple times, copying his movements) do the same thing. She wants it so bad but he's not paying attention!
                        <br><br>
                        The scene in the movie is much more direct, I feel like he really does try to let her down gently in the musical. Their relationship and Warner entirely is something I'll have to save for another page, but I like how (aside from in the OBC recording, where most of the dialouge is cut) he does even say that he talked to his parents about marrying Elle, but that they didn't like that idea. This is only implied in the movie.
                        <br><br>
                        The demo highlights this more that Warner was just with Elle because he knew that she wasn't the type of person his parents approved of, but stayed with her anyways. He knew that she was in it for real ("your love has been so pure") but he was never going to be truly serious about her and is now owning up to that ("I'm gonna make things right").
                        <br><br>
                        Technically, there were a few changes between the very first few shows and the OBC recording, but him not saying "it's" a second time at some point doesn't feel justifyiable enough to make more entries...
